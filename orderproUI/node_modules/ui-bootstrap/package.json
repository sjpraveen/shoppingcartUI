  "readme": "# ui-bootstrap\n\n> Adds a complete Ember Bootstrap 4.x eco-system\n\n> THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS ... it works but it will be \"ready\" pretty soon\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n# if you want to use SASS (recommended)\nember install ember-cli-sass\n# then, either ...\nember install ui-bootstrap\n# - or -\nember install ui-bootstrap-plus\n```\n\nInstalling `ui-bootstrap` will install Bootstrap 4.x locally to your project as an NPM dependency. If you install `ui-bootstrap-plus` then it will include all of these complimentary plugins as well:\n\n  - [`ui-icon`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-button) - font icons at your fingertips (uses fontawesome by default)\n  - [`ui-button`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-button) - bootstrap enabled button controls (includes tether and tooltips)\n  - [`ui-input`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-input) - bootstrap enabled input controls (includes tether and tooltips)\n  - [`ui-tooltip`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-tooltip) - _not done yet_\n  - [`ui-dropdown`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-dropdown) - _not done yet_\n  - [`ember-cli-flash`](https://github.com/poteto/ember-cli-flash) - great alert functionality that can be used with the Bootstrap alert styling\n  - [`ember-modal-dialog`](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-modal-dialog) - Great support for modals in Ember.\n  - [`ember-tether`](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-modal-dialog) - allows Ember to leverage all the positional panache of [Hubspot Tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/).\n\n> **Note:** starting with Bootstrap 4, _glyphicons_ are no longer included in Bootstrap and are not part of this addon either. If you want some Ember help in using icon-libraries try [`ui-icon`](https://github.com/lifegadget/ui-icon)\n\n## Usage\n\n### SASS / CSS\n\nThis plugin detects if you've installed the `ember-cli-sass` addon. If you have it will use SASS, not then it will fallback to CSS (you'll get an info message in this case when you run `ember serve`).\n\n#### SCSS\n\nTo get your Bootstrap mojo you'll need to include the following line to your `app.scss`:\n\n```SASS\n@import 'bootstrap';\n// ... or ...\n@import 'bootstrap-flex';\n```\n\nOne of the really nice things about BS4 is that it can optionally use **flexbox** for all it's spacial positioning. You do lose a tiny bit of browser support but not much these days.\n\n> **Note:** that by importing either of the two above you are importing _all_ of Bootstrap and that maybe more than you need. You can, when using SCSS, selectively import only what you need. As a targeted optimization for people using this plugin and sticking to it's no-JS metaphor you can use `ui-bootstrap` and `ui-bootstrap-flex` as more optimized targets.\n\n#### CSS Users\n\nIf you are stuck using CSS rather than SCSS, you will need to change the options for this plugin in your `environment.js` file:\n\n```js\nvar ENV = {\n  uiBootstrap: {\n    useSASS: false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's all that's needed but of course with this change you loose the ability to modify the SCSS variables which Bootstrap exposes.\n\n### JS / Components\n\nThe philosophy with this addon is to NOT include bootstraps JS as in most cases there are better ways to achieve these goals with Ember addons. See our approach to each of these components below, and in the next section we'll discuss how to enable or disable various aspects.\n\nIn addition, where Bootstrap _components_ don't have any javascript dependencies we have added Ember composable components. See the \"component\" tab on the demo site to find out more.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
